Stable Diffusion

NOTE: Stable Diffusion 2 Just recenetly released, and the video I recorded did not include this. However,
this notebook was updated to use that.

Before running this, you must have an account on https://huggingface.co/
From there, go to your settings, then Access Tokens. Copy and paste that when prompted to log in to your
hugging face account.

When using the Colab notebook, make sure you're using a GPU for your runtime type.
For a local web gui version, see this github repo: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
